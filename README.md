problem statement 1 :--> 
Research in cognitive science and psychology has historically been confined to controlled laboratory settings, relying on specialized, expensive equipment and desktop software. This approach, while precise, severely limits the scale and demographic diversity of participant pools, often leading to findings that are not generalizable. Furthermore, the technical complexity of deploying millisecond sensitive experiments on the web has been a significant barrier for researchers, preventing them from accessing larger, more representative samples online.
